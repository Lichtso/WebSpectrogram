# WebSpectrogram

This is a web tool used to analyze signals such as music using the [Rust & WASM port](https://github.com/Lichtso/complex_continuous_wavelet_transform) of the [C & Python library](https://github.com/Lichtso/CCWT) CCWT. The results are rendered using WebGL to allow gamma adjustment and additional color schemes.
